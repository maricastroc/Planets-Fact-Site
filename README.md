## üìö Project Description
This is a solution to the challenge [planets-fact-site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f).

In this project, I developed an 8-page fact site for all planets in our solar system. Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs

### üìå What did I learn?

This was the first project where I had the opportunity to build a carousel with the useEmblaCarousel hook. I found its documentation extremely well written, allowing an easy understanding of the offered resources. Also, in this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with many of ReactJS features, using styled-components, contexts, reducers, routing with React Router DOM. Also, I was able to work deeper with TypeScript, allowing a better organization project's files and preventing bugs.

I intend to incorporate swipe gestures for mobile devices and keyboard functionality to enhance accessibility. Additionally, I aspire to create customized planet SVG files and animate them, thereby creating a visual effect simulating a 3D rotation.
